==Unitc==

Unitc is a small unit converter written in Python. The Toolkit is GTK.  You can choose between different categories, list the available units and then convert from one unit into another.

I hope you can help me to improve unitc :)

==INSTALL==

Download the files with the command:
svn co http://neo1973-germany.de/svn/unitc/
or directly via the webinterface into a dir. 

Then excecute the install.sh script. It moves the files into the right dirs.
