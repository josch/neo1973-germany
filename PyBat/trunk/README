PyBat is a tool to set usb in host or devices mode aund to set the charging speed.

If you want PyBat to start when usb is pluged in you have to add a rule to /etc/freesmartphone/oevents/rules.yaml.(your changes will be deleted after an upgrade!)

Example:

1. Creat file /usr/bin/pybat:
        #!/bin/sh
        export DISPLAY=:0
        python /directory/PyBat.py
        exit 0

2. add to /usr/etc/freesmartphone/oevents/rules.yaml (not working yes, so you have to add to /etc/freesmartphone/oevents/rules.yaml): 
        -
                trigger: InputEvent()
                filters:
                        - HasAttr(switch, "USB")
                        - HasAttr(event, "pressed")
                actions: Command('pybat')
